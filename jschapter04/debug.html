                        Error Trapping HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

                    <p class="description">
                        Error trapping and debugging are essential skills that help me identify and fix problems in my
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. In this field, we often encounter various types of errors, such
                        as syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Having a systematic approach to error
                        trapping and debugging can significantly improve the overall quality and maintainability of a
                        web project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        My preferred method for debugging involves using browser developer tools. Almost all modern web
                        browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, provide built-in developer
                        tools that offer various features to inspect and debug code. When I encounter an issue with my
                        HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, I usually open the browser's developer tools, navigate to the console
                        tab, and look for error messages. These messages often contain helpful information about the
                        type of error and its location in the code. Additionally, the Elements tab in developer tools
                        allows me to inspect and modify the HTML and CSS of a page in real-time, making it easier to
                        identify and fix layout and styling issues.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Another technique I use to catch errors, especially in JavaScript, is the practice of inserting
                        "console.log()" statements in the code. By strategically placing these statements throughout my
                        code, I can track the execution flow and see the values of variables at different points in
                        time. This approach helps me understand how my code is behaving and identify potential issues.
                        Additionally, I find it helpful to write clear and concise comments in my code, as it makes it
                        easier to understand the logic and spot inconsistencies when debugging.
